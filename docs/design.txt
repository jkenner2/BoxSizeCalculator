PROBLEM STATEMENT:
A program is needed that determines the box size required from the given 
dimensions of an object. The program should prompt the user for the length, 
width, and height of the object in inches and the breakability of the object. 
It should determine the box size for the object and display the result. 
(For breakability, nonbreakable items need no additional space, somewhat 
breakable items need +2 inches on each side, extremely breakable need +4 inches 
on each side)

NOUNS:
  Length, Width, Height, Breakability
VERBS:
  Determines, Prompt, Display

INPUTS:
  Length of object
  Width of object
  Height of object
  Breakability of object

PROCESSING:
  Prompt for value of length
  Prompt for value of width
  Prompt for value of height
  Prompt for value of breakability 


  Convert length to number
  Convert width to number
  Convert height to number
  Convert breakability to number

  Put length, width, and height in descending order

  Determine box size

OUTPUT:
  Box Size

SOLUTION ALGORITHM:
  NumberOrder(enteredDims)
    initialize calculatedArray set to 0
    initialize a set to enteredDims[0]
    initialize a set to enteredDims[1]
    initialize a set to enteredDims[3]
    
    IF a is the largest value THEN
      IF b is greater than or equal to c THEN
        put a first, b second, c last
      ELSE
        put a first, c second, b last
    ELSE IF b is the largest value THEN
      IF a is greater than or equal to c THEN
        put b first, a second, c last
      ELSE
        put b first, c second, b last
    ELSE IF c is the largest value THEN
      IF a is greater than or equal to b THEN
        put c first, a second, b last
      ELSE
        put c first, b second, a last
    ELSE IF if all three equal one anther then
      put a first, b second, c last
